# Hi, I’m Gods

Welcome to my GitHub.

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast who is genuinely curious about how systems work, how they break, and how they can be protected. I’m constantly learning, practicing, and improving my skills, one project at a time.

## What I focus on
I’m interested in:
- Cybersecurity fundamentals  
- Threats, vulnerabilities, and basic risk concepts  
- Malware awareness (viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, etc.)  
- Safe computing practices and digital security  
- Learning how attackers think so systems can be better protected  

Most of the projects here reflect my learning journey, practice labs, notes, and small experiments as I grow in the cybersecurity space.

## How I work
I take security seriously. I like to:
- Learn things properly, not just memorize them  
- Ask questions and dig deeper when something isn’t clear  
- Practice what I learn instead of leaving it as theory  
- Improve based on feedback and new knowledge  

I may still be growing, but I’m disciplined, consistent, and committed to getting better.

## Why work with me?
If you’re looking for someone who:
- Is eager to learn  
- Understands the importance of security and responsibility  
- Communicates clearly  
- Takes tasks seriously  

Then I’m someone you can count on. I believe cybersecurity is not just about tools, but mindset, awareness, and continuous learning.

## A little personal note
Every repository here represents effort, curiosity, and progress. I’m building my foundation carefully and honestly, and I’m excited about where this journey will lead.

## Let’s connect
If you’re interested in collaboration, mentorship, or opportunities related to cybersecurity, feel free to reach out.  
I’m always open to learning and growing with others.

Thanks for visiting.
