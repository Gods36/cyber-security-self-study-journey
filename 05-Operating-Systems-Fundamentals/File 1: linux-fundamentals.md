# Linux Fundamentals

Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in cybersecurity and server environments.

## Key Concepts
- File structure begins from the root (/)
- Common directories: /home, /etc, /var, /bin
- Basic commands: ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, rm, cp, mv
- User permissions: read (r), write (w), execute (x)

## Personal Reflection
Learning Linux is essential for ethical hacking and penetration testing.
