## 🧭 Core Ethical Principles

### 1️⃣ Authorization (Permission First)

- Unauthorized testing is illegal, even if your intention is "just testing".

### 2️⃣ Confidentiality
If you encounter:
- Personal data  
- Financial information  
- Company trade secrets  

You must **not disclose, copy, or misuse** the information.

---

### 3️⃣ Integrity
During testing or security work, do NOT:
- Modify production data
- Damage systems
- Install backdoors
- Leave persistent access

---

### 4️⃣ Responsibility
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly.
- Do not exploit security flaws for profit, revenge, or fame.
- Follow responsible disclosure policies.

---

### 5️⃣ Legal Compliance
- Always comply with applicable cyber laws.
- Example (Nigeria): Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act, 2015.
- Ethical hackers operate strictly within legal boundaries.
