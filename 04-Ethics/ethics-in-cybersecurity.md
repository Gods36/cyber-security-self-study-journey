# Ethics in Cybersecurity

Ethics in cybersecurity means following moral principles and professional rules when protecting or testing systems.

## Why Ethics is Important
Cybersecurity professionals:
- Can access private data.
- Can see confidential information.
- Can break into systems.
Without ethics, this becomes dangerous.

## Core Ethical Principal in Cybersecurity
- Authorization (Permission first). Never test or break into systems without permission. Even if you are just testing, without permission, it is illegal.
- Confidentiality. If you see: Personal data, bank details, company secrets. You must never share or misuse it.
- Integrity. Do not: Alter data, damage systems, plant backdoors. Even during testing.
- Responsibility: Report vulnerabilities responsible. Do not exploit them for money or fame.
- Legal Compliance: Follow cyber laws.
