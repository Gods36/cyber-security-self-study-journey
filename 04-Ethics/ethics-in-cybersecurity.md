# Ethics in Cybersecurity

Ethics in cybersecurity means following moral principles and professional rules when protecting or testing systems.

## Why Ethics is Important

Cybersecurity professionals:
1. Can access private data.
2. Can see confidential information.
3. Can break into systems.

Without ethics, this becomes dangerous.
