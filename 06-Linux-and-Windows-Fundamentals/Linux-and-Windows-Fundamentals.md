# 🐧 Linux Fundamentals

Linux is very important for hackers.  
Most hacking tools run on Linux (especially Kali Linux).

## Important Linux Basics

### 1️⃣ File System Structure
Linux does NOT use `C:\`.

It uses:
- `/` (root)  
- `/home`  
- `/etc`  
- `/var`  
- `/bin`  

### 2️⃣ Basic Commands

```bash
ls      # list files
cd      # change directory
pwd     # show current directory
mkdir   # create folder
rm      # remove file
cp      # copy file
mv      # move file
```

### 3️⃣ Permissions
Linux has:
- Read (r)  
- Write (w)  
- Execute (x)  

Example:
```bash
chmod 755 filename
```

### 4️⃣ Root User
Root = Administrator in Linux.  
Root has full power.  
Hackers often try to gain “root access.”
