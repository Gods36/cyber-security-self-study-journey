# Overview of Cybersecurity Roles

## SOC (Security Operations Center)
SOC analysts monitor systems, detect security incidents, and respond to threats in real time.

## Penetration Testing (PenTest)
Penetration testers simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities before malicious hackers exploit them.

## GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)
GRC focuses on creating policies, managing risks, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations.

## Personal Reflection
I am particularly interested in SOC (Security Operation Center) & PenTest (Penetration Testing), and that's because it involves hands on security monitoring, testing and problem solving.
