# Evaluation and Domains of Cybersecurity

## Evaluation of Cybersecurity
Evaluation of cybersecurity means assessing how effective security measures are in protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats.

## What Cybersecurity Evaluation Involves:
- Checking security weaknesses (vulnerabilities).
- Testing how well systems prevent cyber attacks.
- Monitoring for threats and breaches.
- Reviewing security policies and controls.

## Domains of Cybersecurity:
Domains of cybersecurity are the main areas where security measures are applied.

## Major Domains of Cybersecurity:
- Network Security: Protects networks from unauthorized access and attacks.
(E.g): Firewalls, intrusion detection systems.
- Application Security: Protects software and applications from threats.
(E.g): Secure coding, App updates.
- Information Security: Protects data from unauthorized access, alteration, or loss.
(E.g): Encryption, access control.
- Cloud Security: Protects data and services stored online.
(E.g): Securing Google Drive, Cloud servers.
- Operational Security: Focuses on processes and rules for handling and protecting data.
(E.g): User permissions and security policies.
- Endpoint Security: Protects devices like phone, laptops, and tablets. 

## Personal Reflection
Understanding domains helps me see how cybersecurity applies to different areas of digital infrastructure.
