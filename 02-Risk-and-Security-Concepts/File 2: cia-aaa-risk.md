- Integrity: Ensuring data is accurate and not altered without permission.
- Availability: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.

## AAA
- Authentication: Verifying the identity of a user.
- Authorization: Determining what actions a user is allowed to perform.
- Accounting: Tracking and recording user activities.

## Risk Concept
Risk is the possibility of loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

Risk = Likelihood × Impact
