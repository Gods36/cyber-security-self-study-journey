# Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Exploits

## Threat
A threat is any potential danger that can cause harm to a system, network, or data.

## Vulnerability
A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by a threat.

## Exploit
An exploit is a method or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability to carry out an attack.

## Personal Reflection
A system becomes risky when a threat successfully exploits a vulnerability.
